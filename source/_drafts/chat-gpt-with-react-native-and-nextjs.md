# 引言

[OpenAI](https://openai.com/) just launched [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) - a new AI model that can answer all your questions.

I went deep down the rabit hole asking the most random question and testing "what else" can ChatGPT answer. After some good hours, my mind was blown 🤯  and I started asking myself how long untill even the developers will be replaced by AI.

Fear aside, ChatGPT is trully a very powerful technology that opens the door to so many new opportuninties. It makes AI and Machine learning accessible to any developer, even beginers.

Let’s get our hands dirty with ChatGPT, and integrate it into a real project.

What project should we build?

Let’s be lazy, and just ask ChatGPT for some ideas 💡

And just like that, we have 7 unique project ideas generated by ChatGPT itself.

# 规划

In this tutorial, we'll show you how to use ChatGPT with React Native and NextJS to create a Christmas gift generator that can be used on both the web and mobile platforms.

First, let's take a look at what each of these technologies is and how they work together. ChatGPT is a powerful language model developed by OpenAI that can be used to generate text based on a given input. React Native is a popular JavaScript framework for building native mobile apps, while NextJS is a framework for building server-rendered React apps.
